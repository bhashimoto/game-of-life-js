# Conway's Game of life
Hand-rolled implementation of Conway's Game of Life in vanilla Javascript.

## To Do
- Iteration counter
- Population counter
- Step iterations
- Custom initial state (paint on screen)
- Random initial state

## Issues
- Canvas is only filling half the screen when simulation plays
